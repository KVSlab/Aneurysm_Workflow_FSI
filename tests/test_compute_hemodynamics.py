def test_compute_hemodynamics(tmpdir):
    """
    Here we use the velocity data from Hagenâ€“Poiseuille flow in a pipe to test the computation of hemodynamics indices.
    The analytical solution for the velociy is u = G/(4*mu) * (R^2 - r^2),
    where G is the pressure gradient divided by the pipe length, mu is the viscosity,
    R is the radius of the pipe, and r is the distance from the center of the pipe.
    In this example problem, we used G = 4, mu = 1, R = 1, and the length of the pipe is 5.
    WSS is defined as WSS = mu * du/dr |r=R, which gives WSS = G * R / 2 = 2 Pa in this case.

    We defined wall region excluding the two ends of the pipe, and then average the WSS over the wall region.
    Finally, we assert that the average WSS is within 1.95 and 2.05 Pa to pass the test.
